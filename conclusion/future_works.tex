%  In terms of the future works, some more comparison with other algorisms could be of our interest. Least square fitting using MCMC \cite{ref:MCMC} and some other exact inference approaches could be performed on the same model and observed data, as the standard deviation at each measurement point is known. By comparing to these methods, differences in the inference results, algorithm robustness and required computational resources could be revealed and possibly help us in choosing an inference algorism that can balance the trade-off between efficiency and a reasonable good `fit'. Also there other implementation options of ABC SMC worth trying, e.g. CUDA acceleration and \verb|Julia| implementations\footnote[1]{\url{https://github.com/tanhevg/GpABC.jl}} \footnote[2]{\url{https://github.com/marcjwilliams1/ApproxBayes.jl}}.
