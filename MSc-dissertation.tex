\chapter{Mathematical modelling}

Mathematical models can describe different kinds of dynamic system, and can be used as a guide to prediction and analysis. An ideal model in this case, can represent reasonable interactions/effects between cells and cytokines and recover the observed  trend against time. 

Models for the regeneration process is in the form of ordinary differential equations, specifically the time differential form. Terms in the ODE are mostly explainable and corresponds interaction paths. 

\section{Observed data}

Our models is built regarding the existing experiments data form Tsarouchas et al.\cite{ref:Tsarouchas}. The measurement includes the number of three kinds of cells (neutrophil $N$, macrophage $\Phi$ and microglia) and the relative concentration of four cytokines (il-1$\beta$, tnf-$\alpha$, tgf-$\beta$1a and tgf-$\beta$3). As proposed in \cite{ref:Tsarouchas}, neutrophil and macrophage play important roles in the promotion of spinal cord regeneration with il-1$\beta$ and tnf-$\alpha$ being the mediation. According to this, our current models focus on the changes of four variables $N$, $\Phi $, $\beta$ (il-1$\beta$) and $\alpha$ (tnf-$\alpha$). $N$ and $\Phi$ is of the unit `number of cells', $\beta$ and $\alpha$ is of the unit `relative concentration'.

It is noted that the variance of the measured data is relatively high. The summary statistic used for the parameter estimations is mean of measurement, assuming that measured data is Gaussian-like distributed. The distribution of the measured data points is plotted and examined to see if the measurement mean could represent the distribution. The result is that at most time points the measurement values are Gaussian-distributed, some distributions are skewed. One abnormal distribution is observed at time point 120 h post-lesion (hpl) for macrophage where there are two concentrations. Mean value can summarise most data measures and thus is still used as the target summarised observed data. A plot of the mean of the four variables is shown in Figure \ref{fig:obs_data}

\end{figure}

\section{Hypothesis and Models}

5 models in total are proposed according to different hypothesis. At first our tests and implementations of ABC SMC for parameter estimations use only the basic model for developing propose. After the parameter estimation framework is built and tested, more models are proposed, in order to calibrate and adjust the basic model such that it can be more close to the true process, recover more features of the observed data or test our hypothesis. 

All these models assumes the interactions is within two kinds of cells (neutrophil and macrophage) and two kinds of cytokines (il-1$\beta$ and tnf-$\alpha$) and use the data presented in Figure \ref{fig:obs_data} for parameter estimation. Interactions or effects from other cells or cytokines is not considered as there might not be corresponding data.

\subsection{Basic model}

A preliminary model is proposed according to \cite{ref:Tsarouchas} and used to build and test the code. A interaction map illustrate the model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:m1}. This model is a simplification a the process described in \cite{ref:Tsarouchas}. To describe the parameters' units, we denote the unit of $N$ and $\Phi$ i.e. number of cells as `cell', and denote the unit of $\beta$ and $\aleph$ i.e. relative mRNA expression as `unit' for simplicity.

\subsection{Alternative models}

\paragraph{Model 2 and model 3}

As the observed data indicates, this dynamic system has a steady state where the  inflammation is resolved and immune cells should not be present at the injury site. Regarding this, the self-increase term $\lambda$ cannot be constant, thus a exponentially decay $\lambda$ term is introduced and model 2 is proposed as Eqn. \ref{eq:model2}. The inhibition of il-1$\beta$ being produced by neutrophil, i.e. $i_{\beta\Phi}$ is considered to be ignored, in which case the relative expression of il-1$\beta$ is only affected by the number of neutrophil and the negative feedback from itself. This case corresponds to model 3, written as Eqn. \ref{eq:model3}.

Model 2 and model 3 has one extra parameter $a$ which is a coefficient in the exponentially decay determining the decay speed, with the unit $h^{-1}$.

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:model2}
    \begin{split}
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} t}=\lambda_Ne^{-at}+\kappa_{N\beta}\beta-\mu_NN-\nu_{N\Phi}N\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi}{\mathrm{d} t}=\kappa_{\Phi\beta}\beta-\mu_\Phi\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \beta}{\mathrm{d} t}=\frac{s_{\beta N}N}{1+i_{\beta\Phi}\Phi}-\mu_\beta\beta\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha}{\mathrm{d} t}=s_{\alpha\Phi}\Phi-\mu_\alpha\alpha
    \end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:model3}
    \begin{split}
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} t}=\lambda_Ne^{-at}+\kappa_{N\beta}\beta-\mu_NN-\nu_{N\Phi}N\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi}{\mathrm{d} t}=\kappa_{\Phi\beta}\beta-\mu_\Phi\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \beta}{\mathrm{d} t}=s_{\beta N}N-\mu_\beta\beta\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha}{\mathrm{d} t}=s_{\alpha\Phi}\Phi-\mu_\alpha\alpha
    \end{split}
\end{align}

Model 3 can be regarded as a simplification of model 2, as it can be regarded as model 2 with parameter $i_{\beta\Phi}=0$. For these three models, model 1 is a naive one that is proposed at very first time and used as a `template' to build and test parameter inference framework. As the implementation is successful, model 2 and 3 is proposed. After fitting model 2 is supposed to be better than model 1 as it corrects the problem that appears at the final time points which are close to steady states for neutrophil and macrophage. model 3 is a small simplification of model 2 and theoretically less general than model 2.

\paragraph{Model 4 and model 5}

After the first model selection experiment, it is found that some significant features presented in the observed data is not recovered by any of the model. According to that, attempts are tried to introduce more interactions within the dynamic system considering the both biological and  mathematical context. Extra promoting effect to the expression of tnf-$\alpha$ is considered, by either add a phenomenological term (which means the same effect as directly promoting but the underlying mechanism is unclean) or add a term that represents a promoting effect to the production process of tnf-$\alpha$, namely model 4 (Eqn. \ref{eq:model4}) and model 5 (Eqn. \ref{eq:model5}).

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:model4}
    \begin{split}
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} t}=\lambda_Ne^{-at}+\kappa_{N\beta}\beta-\mu_NN-\nu_{N\Phi}N\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi}{\mathrm{d} t}=\kappa_{\Phi\beta}\beta-\mu_\Phi\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \beta}{\mathrm{d} t}=s_{\beta N}N-\mu_\beta\beta\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha}{\mathrm{d} t}=s_{\alpha\Phi}\Phi-\mu_\alpha\alpha+d_{\beta\alpha}\beta
    \end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:model5}
    \begin{split}
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} t}=\lambda_Ne^{-at}+\kappa_{N\beta}\beta-\mu_NN-\nu_{N\Phi}N\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi}{\mathrm{d} t}=\kappa_{\Phi\beta}\beta-\mu_\Phi\Phi\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \beta}{\mathrm{d} t}=s_{\beta N}N-\mu_\beta\beta\\
        &\frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha}{\mathrm{d} t}=(s_{\alpha\Phi}+f_{\beta\alpha}\beta)\Phi-\mu_\alpha\alpha

\chapter{Parameter estimation and model comparison}

This chapter focuses on the implementation of the ABC SMC on the proposed models. Estimation of  parameters in the proposed models is the main task of this section. ABC SMC-based models selection is another task that can be easily implemented with the parameter estimation framework.

The build and test is under \verb|Python| environment with \verb|pyABC|\cite{ref:pyabc}. Some other code e.g. shell script and \verb|R| code are also used to perform the experiments and analyse the results. Tested software and system environment can be found at Appendix A. The build and test is performed on local computers and HPC clusters available within EPCC.








\section{Implementations and code}

[ABC implementations details, e.g. distance, population, ODE related functions]

According to our preliminary studies, ABC SMC framework implemented using \verb|pyABC| in \verb|Python| is adopted in this project. \verb|pyABC| is a popular SMC software packages \cite{ref:pyabc} that has been used form many SMC studies and applications \cite{ref:adpt_pop}. \verb|pyABC| provides an open-source framework for likelihood-free inference, which is an implementation of ABC SMC algorithm and a tool-box for inference and analysis tasks. Besides, it supports multi-core execution implemented using \verb|multiprocessing| package for scaling-up, which is of our interests and suitable for the followed performance experiments.

The code for the project is developed and tested in local environment (macOS 10.15.6, see Table \ref{table:local_macine}) at first, then the functional version is deployed on compute node of ARCHER and Cirrus for parameter inference experiments and model selection task. The scaling-up experiment is performed on Cirrus, the profiling and its analysis are performed on local machine. Some development and debug are on the remote machines to ensure experiments run correctly on compute node.

The ODE model-related code and utilities are firstly developed to enable reusable functions, variables and data calls. It includes the code for the ODE models, ODE solver, data structures, data format transform functions etc. By doing this in the implementation code file we can set options and activate ABC SMC easily, without creating definition and deplicated code for the models and parameter priors.

Some modifications are made to the source code of \verb|pyABC|. For example, the laboratorial measured data are not considered `complete' for modeling and analysis purpose: there are different measurement time points for cells and cytokines, e.g. cell numbers is not measured at 0.25 hpl and cytokines' expression is not measured at time point 120 hpl. These missing values are treated as `ignored' when calculating the distance between observed data and simulated data. To cope with this built-in distance function code is modified.

Analysis code is also wrapped up into functions which can be easily called after an ABC SMC run is finished. They includes multiple visualisations and summary statistic of the results. For different tasks there are also separated analysis code file. Other analysis tools used in the project include built-in database visualisation tool, R code and Microsoft Excel.

The project code is managed via \verb|git| version-control and available as a GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chaolinhan/MSc_Project}}; it also make the cross machine synchronisation of code versions convenient.

After several development iterations, the code files for ABC SMC implementation now mainly has two types: code file for infer-back experiments (synthetic data), code for parameter inference (experimental data). We can just add more models in these code files for a model comparison task.

\section{ABC SMC and model hyperparameters experiments}

As the key focus of this project is on the parameter estimations of dynamical system, the ability of inference on the proposed model is firstly examined before actual inference using the experimental observed data.

In the first part, synthetic data is used with known true parameter values. The algorithm implementation is evaluated by the efficiency and goodness of resultant model under different implementation options and ABC SMC hyperparameters.

Then according to findings in the first part, several options with good performance are tried in the inference using experimental observed data (Figure \ref{fig:obs_data}). To obtain a more accurate and general results, these experiments are repeated for 3 or more times.

[including the options that are tested/ tried/ not adopted]

[including experiments results and discussions]

[how do these options correspond to biological model and how to set them accordingly for proposed model]

The ABC SMC inference can have largely different performance when using different hyperparameters and implementation options. To firstly test the ability of inference and observe the results of different options, synthetic data with known true parameter values are used as target data. The true value of parameters that are used to generate synthetic data is listed in Appendix B.1. These true values are firstly obtained by fitting a least square fit of model 1 onto the experimental data (Figure \ref{fig:infer_back_data}), the target data is then generated using these parameter values via ODE solver in \verb|Python|. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

    {Synthetic data generated with known parameter values (line plot), compared to experimental data (scatter plot)} 
    \label{fig:infer_back_data}
    
\end{figure}

Among them the following topics are studied using synthetic data.

\subsection{Perturbation kernels}

Perturbation kernels work in the sampling process. In each generation $t$, samples are firstly taken from the previous population $\{\theta_{t-1}\}$ with weights $\{w_{t-1}\}$, then perturbed using the perturbation kernel $K(\theta|\theta^*)$. We keep sampling until $N$ particles are accepted, where $N$ is the pre-set population size. After that the new weights are calculated and normalised. 

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
    \resizebox{1.0\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{fig/smc.png}}
    \end{center}
    
    \caption{ABC SMC sampling process} 
    \label{fig:smc}
    
\end{figure}

The perturbation kernel is called in the sampling of every particles and determines how the new perturbed particle is chosen, thus it is influential to both computation complexity and the resultant posterior distribution. Generally, a local perturbation kernel may face the risk of being stuck in local modes (e,g., local optimal), but it may need less computational operations, or could generate a population with a higher acceptance rate if the successive epsilon values are close; A kernel with wide variance, or spreading out in a large space could help in resolving the local optimal problem by a more thoroughly exploration of the parameter space, however it can be more computation-intensive and result in a lower acceptance rate. A desired optimal kernel should balance the trade-offs; their property and criteria is discussed in \cite{ref:kernel}.

There are several common choice of perturbation kernels. Among them multivariate normal kernel and local M-nearest neighbour model is preferred to be applied on our models. A covariance matrix $\Sigma_t$ of accepted particles is calculated form previous generation and used in multivariate normal kernel: $K(\theta|\theta_{t-1})\sim\mathcal{N}(\theta_{t-1}, \Sigma_t)$. It is illustrated to be more efficient than uniform kernel and component-wise normal kernel in relecting the true posterior structure \cite{ref:kernel}. It has been proved to perform well in several dynamic system models \cite{ref:abcsysbio, ref:compare, ref:disease} for the parameter estimation and model selection tasks. The $scaling\in(0,1]$ parameter in \verb|pyABC| will be multiplied to the covariance to produce a `narrower distributed' perturbation result.

Local M-NN kernel provided by \verb|pyABC| is also tried to provide a comparison. A local kernel density estimation (KDE) fit is used with M nearest neighbours considered.

The kernel experiments is designed to explore the efficiency of SMC on our dynamical systems. Given the same fixed threshold schedule, kernels that need less total samples and have higher acceptance rate would be our preference. The experiments compared multivariate normal kernel with local MNN kernels with different parameters, using synthetic data to infer back the parameters. The acceptance rate among each time point and total required samples are compared after the experiment to give suggestions on the kernel selection in the real data inference. As the threshold schedule is fixed, the final population should have similar discrepancy to the target data thus here the goodness of fit i.e. recover of target data trends/features and errors of the inferred parameters compared to true values is not discussed.

\subsubsection{Kernel experiment results}

To compare kernels, a fixed schedule schedule is used with minimal epsilon i.e. $\epsilon_t$ set to 10.0. From the total required samples graph Figure \ref{fig:kernel1}, the efficiency can be compared. Among the tested kernels, the local M-NN with M=50 has the best performance: it requires the least number of samples and 
has higher acceptance rates among almost all generations. Local M-NN with M=750 is the slowest kernel.

For local M-NN kernels, generally a greater M will lead to lower acceptance rate and 
more required particles in each generation. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:acceptance1}, local M-NN with M=750 is the lowest curve. Consequently, if greater M is test, then it will have even lower acceptance rates; the maximum M=2000 (whole population is considered) will have the lowest acceptance rates.

    \caption{Acceptance rates of different kernels}
    \label{fig:acceptance1}
    
\end{figure}

Multivariate normal kernel has a performance between local M-NN M=250 and M=100. It proves that rather than a trivial normal kernel, multivariate normal kernels is more efficient facing the concentrations of joint distributions among multiple parameters \cite{ref:kernel}. `Scaling' option can narrower the distribution calculated from the last population, thus making the kernel more `local' by sampling under a smaller variance. Similar to small M in local M-NN, small `scaling' is also more efficient in our experiment of the model 1. Besides the fixed threshold schedule, a median threshold schedule with the same final threshold $\epsilon_{20}=10.0$ is also tested and similar results are observed (Figure \ref{fig:kernel2} and \ref{fig:acceptance2}, Appendix B2).

It seems that a more `local' kernel can give better performance by efficiently sampling around concentrations in parameters' distribution and approximate the posterior distribution. This holds in most cases under a given target final threshold value $\epsilon_t$, however may not produce the proper result want: a more local kernel, e.g. local M-NN with small M and multivariate normal with `scaling' is more likely to be stuck in local optimality, as the kernel is less likely to sample particles that are far from local concentrations, although these local optimal are still accepted under given threshold. In other words, using local kernels the epsilon may quickly converge to to local optimal; if a even smaller epsilon is desired, the local kernel can hardly generate enough particles to find another matched local modes. Also, the shapes of posterior distribution will affect the performance of local kernels \cite{ref:kernel}. One obvious example is presented in Figure \ref{fig:kernel1}, where local M-NN with M=50 suffered from a local optimal: the last generation takes much more samples to meet the required threshold.

\subsubsection{Conclusion} Local kernels can be fast bur unstable in some case; for a general parameter inference of our models, multivariate kernels are preferred, as a good fit is our prior target; some local kernels are also worth trying after the multivariate normal kernel, e.g. local M-NN with M$\leq 250$ (for population size of 2000, i.e. 12.5\% of the population) and multivariate normal with scaling. Also multivariate M-NN is worth trying, although it is not built in \verb|pyABC| and requires additional implementations.

\subsection{Adaptive functions and factors}

[how adaptive distance work]

SMC can be more adaptive by introducing adaptive distance function and adaptive population; besides, factors can be applied to manually `normalise' the data.

The trivial distance function is set to Euclidean distance (2-norm distance)

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dis}
    D=\sqrt{\sum_i \Delta x_i^2}
\end{align}

where $i$ is the index of data points and $\Delta x_i$ is the discrepancy between  observed data and simulated data at data point $i$, i.e. $\Delta x_i = x_{i, simulated}-x_{i, observed}$. In this case data points are 12 time points of four variables i.e. 48 data points in total.

A weighted 2-norm distance can be written as 

\begin{align}
    \label{dis_w}
    D=\sqrt{\sum_i w_i \Delta x_i^2}
\end{align}

where a weight $w_i$ is assigned to every data point. If data point $i$ have a higher weight, then the data value is regeared to be more informative, i.e. giving more help in inferring the true posteriors; weights can be either pre-set according to prior knowledge of the problem, or using adaptive method to be dynamically calculated according to , known as adaptive distance. 

Adaptive distance is changing the weights of all data points after each generation iteration, trying to assign informative data points higher weights. Additionally, implementation of adaptive in \verb|pyABC| also introduces additional factors $f_i$ multiplied to weights \cite{ref:adpt_dis} 

\begin{align}
    \label{dis_w}
    D=\sqrt{\sum_i f_iw_i \Delta x_i^2}
\end{align}

Factor is helpful as an option for efficiency. When some data points are equally informative, the manually pre-defined can make the distance more focused on certain data point, or behave like a normalisation that can balance the scales of different summarised statistics (here is the 48 mean values). There are two appliance case studied: (1) factors used as an normalisation option ans (2) factors used to give more focus on some features of the observed data. For (2), as we noticed that the main features (e.g. rapid increase, peaks, fluctuations) are mostly observed in the first half of the time points i.e. 0 - 30 hpl, factors are tried in the later parameter estimation of real data where a more accurate fit of the curve is desired.

Adaptive population \cite{ref:adpt_pop} can adapt the population size of each generation according to the mean correlation of variation error of the previous population. In our early test the maximal population size that is allowed is set to 5,000 and the adaptive strategy always select the upper bound, as a results of wide parameter space or the wide posterior approximation shape.

[what is factor]

[what is adaptive distance]

\subsubsection{Experiments results}

[FIGURE here]

Two types of factors and adaptive distance function are tested by running the same number of generations (20 generation, 2000 particles per generation). From FIGURE, by applying factors the total required samples are less, and the adaptive distance requires much less samples; their acceptance rates are also higher than the standard one. It seems that adaptive function and factors could help to converge more quickly.

However considering the result after 20 generation (FIGURE), the resultant model gives the contrary preference. Applying factors and using adaptive distance can lead the resultant model less accurate (after the same generation iterations): they have wider inter-quantile range and may requires more generations to converge.


\subsubsection{Conclusion} We noticed the significant efficiency improvement of these adaptive options; they can largely improve the acceptance rate in some cases. However, as the factors and weights are directly multiplied to $\Delta x$ and thus the metrics for distance are changed, a direct compare of the efficiency under the same threshold schedule is unfeasible; after the same number of generations they can reach a small $\epsilon_t$ but still the approximated posterior is not as accurate as the standard implementation. AS a result, our implementation of the parameter inference will only consider standard distance function and factors are only tested for improvements (FIGURE).


\subsection{Data size, prior distribution range, population size and generations}

[experiments plan]

Some other hyperparameters, e.g. feed-in data size, prior range, number of generations and number of particles in each generation is also of our interest. Experiments are designed to explore how these options affect the goodness of fit and efficiency of the implementation.

Regarding the present dynamic systems model, the SMC is implemented with two data size options, two prior distribution (standard and wider prior range). The iteration options i.e. population size and number of generaitions are also tried with different values. These experiments intends to give suggestions on the later SMC implementation on experimental data.

\subsubsection{Experiments results}

The results from data size and prior distribution range is shown in FIGURE. The standard implementation is fed with 120 data points (30 data points for each of the four variables), the `less data' is fed with 48 data points, which is the case of the real experimental measurement. Although much less (60\%) data is used, the total required sampling numbers is not much less (XX\%). Although the data size does not affect the sampling process much and the inferred model are all considered acceptable when compared to the synthetic data (FIGURE), cares should be taken when using less data point, or using other more summative statistics, e.g. mean, standard deviation, peak values, starting and ending values etc. As shown in \cite{ref:disease}, less data can lead to a model with more variance, under-fitting or missing some local features e.g. local peak.

The prior range and distribution can largely affect the execution of SMC (FIGURE and FIGURE). Samples are taken from a high dimensional parameter space in each sampling process, wider prior distribution ranges will making each sampling explore more in the parameter vector space. It suggests that a narrower prior is preferred and we should make a more accurate and confident prior belief as possible for the efficiency concerns.

[FIGURE HERE]


\subsubsection{Summary} This subsection aims to preliminarily explore ABC SMC settings using synthetic data with known true parameter values, thus the efficiency and the goodness of the resultant model can be compared across these options. Conclusion can be drawn to choose efficient and proper options of ABC SMC to be applied on the target models with experimental data. It also provides reference for a general inference task using SMC with high dimensional parameter space.








\section{Parameter estimation and model comparison}

[separated ABC run on model 1, 2 and 3]

Using the suggested options in the previous section, the target data (Figure \ref{fig:obs_data}) is prepared as input for the SMC inference framework. Regarding the result, the population size and number of generations are adjusted several times to obtain an general informative posterior which should be stable across repeated runs and avoid local optimal as much as possible.

Parameter estimation of model 1, 2 and 3 was tried with different prior distribution setting: distribution range [0, 25] and [0, 75], amd distribution type uniform and log-uniform. All these ABC SMC runs uses 2,000 particles per population and 30 generations. 

Log-uniform-shaped prior seems to give a better fit of the model, and wider prior range [0, 75] does not give a more accurate result. Then distribution range [0, 25] was tried, in case some parameter have a true posterior laying between [25, 50]. 

The results of prior distribution log-uniform [0, 50] is shown in Figure \ref{fig:result123}. For model 3, the acceptance rates and epsilon path are presented in Figure \ref{fig:result123_2}. For model 3, the estimated parameters' posterior is shown in Figure \ref{fig:para1}. Figure \ref{fig:result123} plots the estimated curve of models, using the mean value of each parameter's approximated posterior; also 1000 particles (each particle is a parameter set) were sampled and used to generate simulated trajectories of the four variable, and the mean (blue) and 25th to 75th percentile range (grey) are calculated from the 1000 simulated data.

Before applying model comparison methods, some features of the three model can still be compared. From simulated curves, It can be seen that all the inter-quartile ranges are tight around the mean value curve, which indicates the approximated posterior are concentrated to some degree; the peak-shaped posterior distributions (Figure \ref{fig:para1}) agrees with this. All epsilon values converges to a steady level, and model 3 has a lower final epsilon value and consequently the simulated trajectory is more close to the observed data (model 3, Figure \ref{fig:result123}).

The acceptance rates is fluctuating and have a gradually increase trend for all the three models, as the acceptance rate becomes higher when the true posteriors are gradually approximated. Compared to model 1, model 2 gives a better fit of the decreasing trend at the second half of the observed data, by using a exponentially decaying
 self-increase rate $\lambda_N$ instead of a constant. The resultant simulated data from model 2 and 3 are in the similar trends and the most obvious difference is that for model 3, the simulated data of $\Phi$ and $\alpha$ are more `flat'. We expect model 3 to be the best model as it reaches a threshold value and intuitively gives a better fit, although the fit could not be considered generally a good representation of the biological process that we want to model, as the simulated data are significantly biased from the observed data for tnf-$\alpha$. A sharp peak at 4 hpl is observed from the measurement (Figure \ref{fig:obs_data}) but no similar features are represented by any of the three models.

[model comparison among model 1, 2, 3]

Next a model selection experiment with different prior was conducted, using the same ABC-SMC framework. As in the parameter inference, two distributions (uniform and log-uniform) are tested with three different interval ([0, 25], [0, 50] and [0, 75]). The results show that model 3 wins with nearly 100\% model probability at most runs after 30 generations, except log-uniform [0, 75]. All the model probability results are of great discrepancy (e.g. 100\% model 3 and 0\% for model 1 and 2), so Bayesian factor is not calculated. 

Figure \ref{fig:cmp1} shows the model selection process, under log-uniform [0, 50] prior distribution. Model 3 gains total advantage over model 1 and 2 after 7th population. Together with conclusions above, model 3 is considered to be the the best model to represent the target data so far.

\chapter{Performance experiments}

The performance experiments are designed to explore the parallel performance of ABC SMC implementations. Usually ABC SMC is a time-consuming and computation intensive task and usually is executed on large clusters. The scheduling strategy, implementation details and many other factors can affect the parallel efficiency.

[MORE meanings of the performance study]

\section{Scaling-up}

First experiments are designed to illustrate the scaling-up performance. The program used here is an implementation of ABc SMC on model 5. The details of the ABC SMC settings is listed below

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prior distribution: default to log-uniform distribution [$1\times 10^{-6}$, 50] for all the 12 parameters
    \item threshold schedule: median epsilon
    \item No factors, no adaptive distance or adaptive population applied
    \item Population size is 2000, with 20 generations
\end{itemize}

[HOW PYABC parallelise the sampling]

For HPC systems like Cirrus, \verb|pyabc| uses \verb|multiprocessing| for multi-core parallel sampling. By default if the number of cores is not specified, it will automatically read the number of available cores and use them all. Cirrus has a 36-core CPU which support hyperthreading, such that the maximal number of cores available to \verb|multiprocessing| is 72.

The program is executed on Cirrus, using 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 54 and 72 cores respectively. Each run is repeated 5 times. The average execution time, required sampling numbers are recorded. Hyperthreading is enabled when using 54 and 72 cores. The access to the node that contains computation cores is exclusive, such that the execution would not be affected by other programs of operations.

The implementation of ABC SMC in \verb|pyabc| enables the parallelisation of sampling, which is the must time-consuming part. The rest part of the program is mostly not parallelised, e.g. database I/O and reductions operations. The sampling process involves sampling, perturbation and test of the acceptance criteria, all of which are computation-intensive. 

In practice, using ABC SMC to estimate the parameters of a given model could cost up to several hundred of hours if the computational resources is limited[REF]. The performance experiment result could provide a reference that illustrate that how the efficiency changes when scaling-up or the trade-offs in computational resources' cost and their benefit.

\subsubsection{Results}

\section{Profiling}

The performance could also be analysed given a profiling report. The second experiment profiles the program to reveal the detailed time consumption for each operation and the possible bottleneck, according to which we could find the hot-spot of program and given possible suggestions on improving the performance. 

In this case, profile tools \verb|cProfile| and \verb|yappi| is used in PyCharm IDE.
