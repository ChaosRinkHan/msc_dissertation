% [WHAT results is outputted and WHAT topics are discussed]

% \section{ABC SMC results}

% [inferred parameters: joint distribution, estimated values and simulated trajectory for each models; sensitivity; features of the inferred model]

% [model selections result; bayes factor]



% \section{Discussions}

% [goodness of fit (evaluation); preferred models and effects of modification to basic model]

% [efficiency and trade-offs in scaling-up]

% [POSSIBLE: compare to exact inference; compared to other implementations]
